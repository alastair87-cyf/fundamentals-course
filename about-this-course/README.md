# About This Course

## What this course IS

A one-month short course from [Code Your Future](https://codeyourfuture.io/)

* You get a taste of programming with JavaScript - one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages today.
* You'll learn fundamentals of programming that can be applied to JavaScript and other languages.
* You'll discover all the benefits of learning to code.
* You'll become familiar with some free on-line resources that we recommend to help in future study.

We'll also look at what you can make with programming and what kind of jobs are available to programmers.

## What this course is NOT

### It's _not_ a web development course

Although we'll certainly learn some JavaScript - the most popular language in web development - we won't do _any_ web development with it!

### It's _not_ a teacher-led course

We're not going to lecture you.

You will work through some online courses, and we \(or the people sitting around you\) will help you when you're really stuck.

### â€¦ and we're _not_ starting with JavaScript!

We'll start to look at JavaScript in week 2. First we're going to use a simpler language to learn and practice fundamentals.
