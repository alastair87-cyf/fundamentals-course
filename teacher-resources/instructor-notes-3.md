## Favourite Khan Academy project presentations

## Pairing

See [last lesson's instructor notes](instructor-notes-2.md#pairing)

We recommend that the trainees focus on using arrays and objects as they should covered this in the coursework. There are some good examples of improvements listed [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course/tree/b9ad64a78202f4e8151b2b7a4c9fbc0be7f05925/post-khan-academy-challenges.md). Most of them involve refactoring an existing project to use an array of objects. Note that objects within arrays is challenging for some trainees so this may need some explanation - perhaps a good live coding topic.

## 1-to-1 assessment

This lesson's assessment is quite similar to last lesson's. We recommend focusing on trainees that most need assessment \(i.e. you know less about their level\), so that you can make decisions about their progress.

The assessment is also structured a little differently to the previous two, as it can be run as a in-class test as well as a 1-to-1 session. If you have many trainees that you need to prioritise, then an in-class test may the best choice, however it sometimes can be difficult to make decisions without observation of the trainee \(they could be along the right lines, just missing a crucial detail\).

Details for this assessment can be found here.

[Khan Academy - Three Boxes](assessments.md#week-4-khan-academy-three-boxes)

## Kahoot

You can run the [same Kahoot quiz from the first lesson](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023). It is interesting to compare the results, hopefully the trainees feel more confident at the end of the course.

## Course reflection

Look through the [concept roadmap](../other-resources/roadmap-of-concepts.md) and demonstrate the programming principles that they learned.

## Other free resources

Recommend some resources for the trainees to continue learning. Remember that not all trainees will continue onto the web development course and so this may be useful for them to keep studying.

The list provided is just a jumping-off point: if you have some recommendations, please add them!

## Migration to p5.js \(Optional\)

If you have extra time or are keen to continue using concepts from the Khan Academy course, then it recommended to migrate to a different Processing-based JS library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The Processing.js library used by Khan Academy is unmaintained whereas p5.js is actively maintained and has an almost identical API.

There are some notes provided about how to migrate the trainee's projects to p5.js/the OpenProcessing platform. Although the migration workshop is not very fleshed out currently.

## Feedback

Please ask your trainees to complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhfO5pSH1UszfJ08w2W4MgkIXE7QdGSc71YGa4rsTSPK3lyQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) so we can get feedback on how trainees found the course.

## Assigning Coursework

At the end of Class, assign the Coursework for this week through Google Classroom.
