## Overview

This lesson is mostly about welcoming students to the course, letting them know the rules and the course and getting them started with Block Based coding.

Be sure to take attendance at the start of class - this will be an important data point for the Selection for the Full Class.

As this is the first class, make sure you chase up students who are having trouble finding the space or connecting online. There will always be problems for the first class!

## Welcome

The aim of this session is to welcome students to the space and get them settled. You should choose an [Energiser ](engergisers.md)and work through it with you students.

Be sure to cover

* A short introduction to CYF and what we do
* What the students will be learning on the course
* The roles of people in the classroom, including
  * Teacher
  * Teaching Assistant
  * Personal Development
  * Any CYF Staff Present \(e.g. City Coordinators\)

## Kahoot

Kahoot is a web app for running quick, fun quizzes with the whole class.

A prepared quiz is [available here](https://play.kahoot.it/v2/?quizId=62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023) \(editor view [here](https://create.kahoot.it/details/62bd599b-af55-41c3-b335-c28c9060c023)\). It is intended to get a general level of confidence in their programming ability from the class. To be able to compare we suggest running it in the first and last classes.

The aim of this quiz is to get to know your students a little and to find out their background. Its important to find out exactly how much your students know before you start teaching.

## Slack

Create a private channel for the class and invite the whole class to it.

Please use the convention \#CITY-Fundamentals-class number \(eg: \#WestMids-Fund-2\)

## Start Code.org coursework in class

It is a good idea to spend some time in the class working through the first few lessons. You can help with problems getting signed in, with the interface, etc.

### Assigning coursework

At the end of Class, assign the coursework for this week through Google Classroom.
