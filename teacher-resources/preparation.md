* Wifi
* Zoom Account
* A good microphone and website

## 2\) Tool Setup

### 2.1\) Google Classroom

In the past we've used Google Classroom to manage coursework assignment and submission.

The easiest way to do this is to copy a class from previous years. Ask your class coordinator how to do this.

Be sure to invite all of the trainees to the classroom before the course starts.

### 2.2\) Code.org Class

Assigning all trainees to a Code.org classroom will make it much easier to track their progress. You can follow the instruction [here](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/115000488132-Creating-a-classroom-section) to get setup.

Be sure to invite all of the trainees to the class before the course starts.

### 2.3\) Khan Academy Class

Follow the instructions [here ](https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-for-educators/resources/teacher-essentials/getting-started-on-khan-academy/a/teacher-quick-start-checklist)for to setup a Khan Academy Classroom. This will make it easier to track the trainees progress through the course.

Be sure to invite all of the trainees to the class before the course starts.

In order to monitor trainee progress on the course, it is recommended that several teacher and TA volunteers set themselves up a 'class' in KhanAcademy right at the very start of the course, and then get ALL trainees to join ALL classes. This gives visibility of the trainee rota, their exercise progress, and perhaps most importantly, their project attempts.

trainee progress often won't be updated on your dashboard until as much as 5-10 minutes have passed.

Khan Academy has created some '[How to teach remotely'](https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-for-educators/k4e-us-demo/xb78db74671c953a7:khan-for-educators#xb78db74671c953a7:teaching-remotely-with-khan-academy) training materials.

## 3\) trainee Setup

### 3.1\) Laptops & Hardware

Be sure that all of the trainees have completed the [trainee Preparation](../about-this-course/class-preparation.md) steps before they start the course.

If you have time, a short phone call with each of them to run through the checklist is helpful to save time during your first class. **This is especially important if you are running your class online only.**

### **3.2\) trainee Invites**

At least a week before the first class make sure that all trainees know when and where they are meant to be attending.

It is wise to tell them to be there 5-10 minutes before you plan to start to allow for late comers.

## **4\) Volunteer Setup**

### **4.1\) Teaching Assistants**

This course benefits from their being a few Teaching Assistants to provide one-to-one support to trainees throughout the day. You should make sure that they know the following.

* The aims of the course
* The structure of the days
* What their specific role is - [outlined here ](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/teams/education/education-roles/teaching-assitant)
* When and where they should be attending

### **4.2\) Content Knowledge**

Be sure that you have familiarised yourself with all of the content that is taught over the four weeks of the course.

It is advised that you attempt the coursework yourself to make sure you understand exactly what is expected of the trainees.

## 5\) Prepare for Assessments

On Week 2-4 there are assessments that should be done with trainees to measure their progress through the course. Depending on the number of trainees you have attending the class you'll need extra technical people to run.

Be sure to find people to run these assessments and understand how they will be run.
