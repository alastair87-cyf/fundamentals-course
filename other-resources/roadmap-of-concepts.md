# Roadmap of Concepts

Here is a list of the main concepts we cover in the fundamentals course, and whether you'll see them in the Code.org course or in the Khan Academy course. You **don't** have to remember the name of the concepts! Some trainees like to understand where they are, and how much further there is to go.

| Concept | In Code.org course 3? | In Khan Academy Intro to JS? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple sequence of instructions** | Yes | Yes |
| Order matters | Yes: turn left then forwards, or forward then turn left? | Yes |
| **If/else** \("conditional execution"\) | Yes | Yes |
| **Repetition with "loops"** | Yes: \(repeat n times, repeat until, [while nectar &gt; 0](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/13/puzzle/7)\) | Yes |
| Nested loops | Yes: [example: 11.5](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/11/puzzle/5) | No |
| **Functions** | Yes | Yes |
| Using \("calling"\) a function | Yes: [move forwards](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/2/puzzle/1) | Yes |
| Passing information to a function | Yes: [move forward by 100 pixels](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/21/puzzle/2) | Yes |
| Defining your own functions | Yes: [e.g. "get 7 make 7"](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/6/puzzle/8?section_id=2217957) | Yes |
| Returning information from a function | No | No |
| **Variables** | Not much: [Set color red](https://studio.code.org/s/course3/stage/3/puzzle/4?section_id=2217957) | Yes: `var xPos = 200; xPos++;` |
| **Data Types** | No | Partially |
| **Arrays and Objects** | No | Yes |
