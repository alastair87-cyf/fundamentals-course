# Lesson 3

## Warm up activity: 10.00-10.30

### A picture tells a story

1. Find an image online of an object that represents you or why are are on the course using [Bing Image Search](https://images.bing.co.uk).  
2. Add the image to our Slack thread and an explanation of why you chose that particular object.  
3. Once you have completed your post, look at what other people have posted.
4. When you find any interesting images and ask that person a follow up question about it by tagging them in your reply (e.g. @dave).
5. Try to reply to people's questions.

## General Questions & Answers: 10.30-10.45

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](https://fundamentals.codeyourfuture.io/teacher-resources/instructor-notes-1#shout-out-questions)

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them in a thread on Slack.

---
## Break: 10.45-10.50

---

## Getting Unstuck: 10.50-11.20

---
_Zoom Admin Instructions_

For this section the class needs to be split into roughly equal breakout rooms with at least one mentor in each room.

---

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](https://fundamentals.codeyourfuture.io/teacher-resources/instructor-notes-2#getting-unstuck)

We'll now spend 30 minutes where you can ask the volunteers with help on serious _questions that have really been blocking your progress_ through the Khan Academy course.

If you have other more advanced questions that aren't blocking you, please **don't** ask them yet \(unless you see that the volunteers are clearly not busy helping with more fundamental issues\). We'll have time later for those questions.

## Problem Solving: 11.20-12.00

Problem solving is a critical skill for programmers, including for experts. Often programmers spend most of their day solving problems in their code. Learning how to solve problems efficiently is an extremely useful skill.

## Lunch: 12.00-13.00

---
## Live Coding: 13.00-13.45

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](https://fundamentals.codeyourfuture.io/teacher-resources/instructor-notes-2#live-coding)

The instructor will do some _live-coding_ to demonstrate solutions to some of the class's common questions. This means they will be showing their screen on the projector and working on solving a problem. This is a very effective way to learn! The instructors are professionals and there are many small \(and large!\) tips you can pick up from them.

Can you spot the instructor's coding mistakes before they do? \(There will definitely be some, that is normal!\)

The instructor will likely ask for suggestions on how to do something from the class = speak up, it helps the their teaching. Don't worry about getting the answer "wrong" - there is no one correct way. They might also ask you to do some of the coding, please contribute and don't worry about mistakes!

_Tip_: A quiet class with no questions or suggestions is a difficult class to teach

## Break: 13.45-13.50

---
## Pair Programming: 13.50-14.50

### Introduction

[_Instructors see here for instructions_](https://fundamentals.codeyourfuture.io/teacher-resources/instructor-notes-2#pairing)\_\_

It's good to code with a friend. You learn SO much. Programmers call this _pair programming_ and many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day.

{% embed url="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11XKf7yVRh6Z6pcfgXeM9WxDLvmDT7hUEb5QkLOuHlDo/edit" caption="" %}

### Zoom Remote Control

For this session we would normally have you sit together at the same machine however if that is not possible then Zoom provides a way for you to share control of a single computer virtually.

In your pairs you will need to decide which of you will share, and who will work remotely. It is likely you will both need to unmute in order to communicate.

As a pair you will have been placed in a breakout toom by the class Zoom Master. The person who is going to share their screen will need to press the green Share Screen button in the centre of the bar at the bottom of the Zoom window. Then, when you are ready to lend control to your partner, move your mouse to the top centre of the screen, click the Remote Control button and then click on your partner's name.
### Khan Academy

---
_Zoom Admin Instructions_

For this session the trainees need to be divided into breakout rooms of two each, so that they can work together on a pair programming exercise. You can prepare the rooms in advance and the teacher will advise you when to start and end

---

Now we'll work in _pairs_ on the following Khan Academy challenge:

[_Challenge: Moles in Holes_](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/functions/pc/challenge-moles-in-holes)

We'll talk VERY briefly about what pair-programming is and how you can do it. Here are some tips on how to pair well:

* Switch between _driver_ and _navigator_ roles every 10 minutes
  * The "driver" is the person typing on the keyboard, just thinking about what needs to be written
  * The "navigator" reviews what the driver is doing and is thinking about to write next
* Don't dominate - this is teamwork
  * Even when you're in charge of the keyboard you are not in charge of all the decisions
  * Try to find agreement with your partner
  * If you think you know more and better than your partner then take the opportunity to help them learn. The more they do, the more decisions they make, the more chance they'll have to reflect and learn
* Defend yourself - some partners will try to dominate and rule the keyboard or dictate every decision
  * Make sure you get your turn at the keyboard, and speak up when you have ideas
  * Ask for your partner to slow down if they're going too fast or to explain if they are adding code you don't understand
  * Take responsibility for gaining that understanding, and ask for help from your partner in getting there

More general tips:

* Pick a partner who is roughly at your level and ideally who is interested in a similar programming task \(e.g. animating a fish in the fish tank project, or improving the text on an Ad Design project\)
* _Define a small task clearly_ that you are both happy to work on together. You need clarity or you may be "pulling in two different directions". Example dialogue that you might have with your partner:
  * "Well, I'd like to add a column of bubbles above each fish."
  * "Yes, I like that idea"
  * "But let's not try to animate them, at least not in this first task?"
  * "Yep, let's keep it simple!  Once we've got them showing up correctly, we can decide what's next!"
  * "So, just like.. 5 bubbles spaced out in a vertical line above the front of each fish?"
  * "Let's do it! :\)"
  * ... they are successful
  * "hmm, maybe let's add a little randomness to their position so it looks more natural"
  * "ooh, sounds good. i don't know how to do that"
  * "well, it's your turn on the keyboard now, anyway.  i'll talk you through it.  do you know what the random\(\) function does?"
  * ...

#### I'm stressing out!

This will only be a short \(20-30 minutes\) pairing task, so don't stress if you find don't get on with your partner. This happens to professionals, and employers REALLY care how you behave in a pairing session, so treat it as important practice, and try to find a way to get on.

Often this stress can arise between two dominant personalities both of whom think they are right. If this is your case it might be clever for you to let the other person make more of the decisions.

#### Reflect on pair-programming

* two minutes
* easy/hard?
* advantages? disadvantages?
* any tips?
* in perspective: this happens in industry and in coding interviews.  we'll keep practicing.

You will be free \(and encouraged\) to work like this in some of the sessions this afternoon. Provided you follow the guidelines above \(importantly, there is _driver_ and _navigator_ there is no _back seat_ to fall asleep in.

#### Super important rule for the future

If you are working in a pair \(or team\) so that you can hide what you don't understand, but you think it is ok because the team are getting the work done, you are failing yourself. Hiding like this is one of the few ways to genuinely mess up.

SHOW what you don't understand, and get help with it. Otherwise you will never learn, and there won't be other people there to support you. Find a team to work in that is at YOUR level, and work on a simpler task that is one you fully understand, at your speed.

## Coursework (14.45-15.00)
