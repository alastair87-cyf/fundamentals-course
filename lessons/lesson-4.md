# Lesson 4

## Warm-up: 10.00-10.30

We will have a brief warm-up exercise.
## General Questions & Answers: 10.30-10.55

\_\_[_Instructors see here for instructions_](https://fundamentals.codeyourfuture.io/teacher-resources/instructor-notes-1#shout-out-questions)

Let's make a list of all of the programming questions we'd like to get answered today, and put them in a thread on Slack.
## Live Coding - Arrays and Objects: 11.00-12.00

The instructor will do some _live-coding_ to demonstrate solutions to some of the class's common questions. This means they will be showing their screen on the projector and working on solving a problem. This is a very effective way to learn! The instructors are professionals and there are many small \(and large!\) tips you can pick up from them.

Can you spot the instructor's coding mistakes before they do? \(There will definitely be some, that is normal!\)

The instructor will likely ask for suggestions on how to do something from the class = speak up, it helps the their teaching. Don't worry about getting the answer "wrong" - there is no one correct way. They might also ask you to do some of the coding, please contribute and don't worry about mistakes!

_Tip_: A quiet class with no questions or suggestions is a difficult class to teach

# Lunch: 12.00-13.00
## Improve your Khan Academy Projects with Arrays and Objects: 13:30-14:20

**Zoom Master: Students need to be in rooms of two (without a mentor). All mentors should be co-hosts.**

Like last week, we'll work in _pairs_ to make the changes to your favourite Khan Academy you described in your presentation earlier. Remember that if you and your pair are totally stuck on something, ask a volunteer to help you - they're here to help!

If you have finished all of the Khan Academy projects up to and including the arrays and objects sections and you need some inspiration, [here is a list of further challenges](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course/tree/223d67a828fe3554aa7bcceb3bbc6f125a390e49/lesson-4/post-khan-academy-challenges.md). These mostly challenge you to return to an earlier project and make a spin-off which uses objects and/or arrays to make it better, cleaner, and to make it easier for you to do cooler things!

### Pair-programming \(2 trainees\)

It's good to code with a friend. You learn SO much. Programmers call this _pair programming_ and many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day.

If you need a reminder on how to pair-program effectively, see the [the notes from lesson 3](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/fundamentals-course/tree/223d67a828fe3554aa7bcceb3bbc6f125a390e49/lesson-4/lesson-3.md#pair-programming).

### Zoom Remote Control

For this session we would normally have you sit together at the same machine however if that is not possible then Zoom provides a way for you to share control of a single computer virtually.

In your pairs you will need to decide which of you will share, and who will work remotely. It is likely you will both need to unmute in order to communicate.

As a pair you will have been placed in a breakout toom by the class Zoom Master. The person who is going to share their screen will need to press the green Share Screen button in the centre of the bar at the bottom of the Zoom window. Then, when you are ready to lend control to your partner, move your mouse to the top centre of the screen, click the Remote Control button and then click on your partner's name.

## Buddying introduction: 14.25-14.55

We'll now spend 30 minutes going over the buddy system that will operate during the main class to help support you.
## Coursework: 14.55-15.00

Make sure you understand the coursework for next week before you leave the classroom. See Google Classroom for the definitive list of coursework assignments. Make sure you check it regularly.

### 1\) Khan Academy: Intro to JS

Finish the [Khan Academy: Intro to JS course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

**IMPORTANT!!**

You should **SKIP** the "Object-Orientated Design" section. It is out-of-date and confusing!

### 2\) Learning How to Learn course

Continue to **Week 4** of the [Learning How to Learn course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It should take around 4 hours to complete.

### 3\) \(Optional\) Continuing with JavaScript Drawing and Animation

If you enjoyed using JavaScript to make drawings and animations, we recommend further study and play with the p5.js library, using the [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org) platform or CodePen.

Here are some [notes on moving to p5.js](after-the-course/from-khan-academy-processingjs-to-p5js.md).

If we have time, we will do [a short workshop on moving your work to to p5.js](after-the-course/p5js-and-openprocessing-workshop.md).

#### Some places to get inspiration with p5.js

Here is an essay by Jason Bailey about "generative art". It has lots of interesting examples which might inspire you: ["Why Love Generative Art?"](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art). If you use Twitter, here is a recommended "generative" artist: [https://twitter.com/manoloidee](https://twitter.com/manoloidee).
